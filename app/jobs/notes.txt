1. Walk-In Drives

"No stress, no resume drama. Just pull up, give the interview, and if you vibe with it – boom, job in hand."

2. Agency Picks

"Agencies got the connects. Drop your resume, they set you up. You pay only after you bag the job – fair deal."

3. Exam & Course Hustle

"Platforms where you grind a bit – crack their test or do a quick course. Clear it and the job’s waiting on the other side."
